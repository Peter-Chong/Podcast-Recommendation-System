Set at the turn of the 19th century, Pride and Prejudice catches a perfect glimpse not only of a time when women were socially and economically dependent solely on their marital status, but also as an age of enlightenment and witness of the French Revolution.This romantic novel with its hint of comic references begins with the famous quote \"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\"This famous quotation sets the story into motion as the eligible Mr. Bingley is introduced as he rides into town. The quote also draws in and to some extent reveals the content of the plot to come. Soon the news of the arrival of the well off Charles Bingley finds its way to the ears of the Bennett household. Having five unmarried daughters, the Bennetts are eager to match them up with suitable spouse candidates and see them prosperously married. After attending a ball, Mr. Bingley is instantly attracted to the oldest Bennett daughter Jane and it is fair to say that the feeling is mutual. Such cannot be said about his close friend Mr. Darcy who rudely refuses to dance with the second Bennett daughter Elizabeth. Consequently, Elizabeth\u2019s first prejudice is born as she labels Mr. Darcy arrogant and obnoxious; however, she later learns never to judge a book by its cover and must swallow up her pride to achieve happiness. Pride and Prejudice witnesses the exciting courtships of the Bennett sisters and their suitors, as well as the not so joyful relationships of other characters. As the novel develops the relationships between the characters must outweigh the forces seeking to tear them apart. Experience the adventures of the Bennett sisters as they face the troublesome issues of manners, social class, family, and marriages in a male reliant society. A story not only portraying the unreliable nature of pride and prejudice, Austen\u2019s classic also paints a vivid image of the past and the woman as a member of society.", "link": "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/pride-and-prejudice-by-jane-austen/id724294998"}, {"title": "The Horror!

Felt busy but not productive? Or like your time is constantly being hijacked by other people\u2019s agendas? I'm Greg McKeown, and welcome to the What's Essential podcast. Through my best-selling book Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less, I've been fortunate to help many people deliberately distinguish the vital few from the trivial many and then remove these obstacles to create a clear path to accomplishing what matters. The Way of the Essentialist is not about trying to fit it all in - it's about fitting in only what matters. Aspiring essentialists are always asking me for how they can apply these principles to their own lives. They want real examples from real people. This What's Essential podcast is my answer. Every week, we have conversations - sometimes with thought leaders, sometimes with celebrities, and often with people like you and me - to understand what they want to prioritize and help them apply Essentialism to achieve their goals in real life. I answer listener questions and talk about my own experiences as well, as I too am an aspiring Essentialist! You're invited to join us and take an hour or two a week to focus on learning how to put what matters to you first.

Hephaestus Research Station, currently on Day 448 of its orbit around red dwarf star Wolf 359. He's stuck on a scientific survey mission of indeterminate length, 7.8 light years from Earth. His only company on board the station are stern mission chief Minkowski, insane science officer Hilbert, and Hephaestus Station's sentient, often malfunctioning operating system Hera. He doesn't have much to do for his job other than monitoring static and intercepting the occasional decades-old radio broadcast from Earth, so he spends most of his time creating extensive audio logs about the ordinary, day-to-day happenings within the station.

Even the simplest of tasks can turn into a gargantuan struggle, and the most ordinary-seeming things have a way of turning into anything but that.

One of the most famous adventure heroes of the 20th century United States, the Shadow has been featured on the radio, in a long-running pulp magazine series, in American comic books, comic strips, television, serials, video games, and at least five films. The radio drama included episodes voiced by Orson Welles.On September 26, 1937, The Shadow radio drama, a new radio series based on the character as created by Gibson for the pulp magazine, premiered with the story \"The Death House Rescue,\" in which The Shadow was characterized as having \"the power to cloud men's minds so they cannot see him.\" As in the magazine stories, The Shadow was not given the literal ability to become invisible.The introduction from The Shadow radio program \"Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!\", spoken by actor Frank Readick Jr, has earned a place in the American idiom. These words were accompanied by an ominous laugh and a musical theme, Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns' Le Rouet d'Omphale (\"Omphale's Spinning Wheel\", composed in 1872). At the end of each episode The Shadow reminded listeners that, \"The weed of crime bears bitter fruit!

Radio Mystery Theater and Mystery Theater, sometimes abbreviated as CBSRMT) was a radio drama series created by Himan Brown that was broadcast on CBS Radio Network affiliates from 1974 to 1982, and later in the early 2000s was carried by the NPR satellite feed.The format was similar to that of classic old time radio shows like The Mysterious Traveler and The Whistler, in that the episodes were introduced by a host (E. G. Marshall) who provided pithy wisdom and commentary throughout. Unlike the hosts of those earlier programs, Marshall is fully mortal, merely someone whose heightened insight and erudition plunge the listener into the world of the macabre (in a manner similar to that of \"The Man in Black\" on yet another old time radio program, Suspense).As with Himan Brown's prior Inner Sanctum Mysteries, each episode of CBS Radio Mystery Theater opened and closed with the ominous sound of a creaking crypt door, accompanied by Marshall's disturbing utterance, \"Come in!\u2026 Welcome. I'm E. G. Marshall.\" This was followed by one of Marshall's other catchphrases, usually either \"The sound of suspense\" or \"The fear you can hear.\" At the conclusion, the door would swing shut, preceded by Marshall's classic sign off, \"Until next time, pleasant\u2026 dreams?\" Marshall hosted the program from January 1974 until February 1982, when actress Tammy Grimes took over for the series' last season, maintaining the format.CBSRMT was broadcast each weeknight, at first with a new program each night. Later in the run three or four episodes were new originals each week, and the remainder repeats. There were 1,399 original episodes. The total number of broadcasts, including reruns, was 2,969.

Paley, a fan of the Philip Marlowe radio series, asked his programming chief, Hubell Robinson, to develop a hardboiled Western series, a show about a \"Philip Marlowe of the Old West\". Robinson instructed his West Coast CBS Vice President, Harry Ackerman, who had developed the Philip Marlowe series, to take on the task.Ackerman and his scriptwriters, Mort Fine and David Friedkin, created an audition script called \"Mark Dillon Goes to Gouge Eye\" based on one of their Michael Shayne radio scripts, \"The Case of the Crooked Wheel\" from the summer of 1948. Two versions were recorded. The first, recorded in June 1949, was very much like a hardboiled detective series and starred Michael Rye (credited as Rye Billsbury) as Dillon; the second, recorded in July 1949, starred Straight Arrow actor Howard Culver in a more Western, lighter version of the same script. CBS liked the Culver version better, and Ackerman was told to proceed.A complication arose, though; Culver's contract as the star of Straight Arrow would not allow him to do another Western series. The project was shelved for three years when producer Norman Macdonnell and writer John Meston discovered it while creating an adult Western series of their own.Macdonnell and Meston wanted to create a radio Western for adults, in contrast to the prevailing juvenile fare such as The Lone Ranger and The Cisco Kid. Gunsmoke was set in Dodge City, Kansas, during the thriving cattle days of the 1870s. Dunning notes, \"The show drew critical acclaim for unprecedented realism.\"Radio cast and character biographiesThe radio series first aired on CBS on April 26, 1952, with the episode \"Billy the Kid\", written by Walter Newman, and ended on June 18, 1961. The show stars William Conrad as Marshal Matt Dillon, Howard McNear as Doc Charles Adams, Georgia Ellis as Kitty Russell, and Parley Baer as Dillon's assistant, Chester Wesley Proudfoot.", "link": "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gunsmoke/id1517662735"}, {"title": "The Black Tapes", "producer": "Pacific Northwest Stories", "genre": "Fiction", "rating": 4.4, "num_ratings": 13200, "num_episodes": 51, "description": "The Black Tapes is a weekly podcast from the creators of Pacific Northwest Stories, and is hosted by Alex Reagan.

For the first time polygamy is dissected through a feminist viewpoint, with attention given to the experiences of the women, women who sacrificed everything and suffered long and are never mentioned in museums or landmark tours. Their experiences, along with interviews with experts, sc20140302_130747holars, historians, and those still affected directly by the practice, paint a new portrait of how the west was shaped, by the hard work and toil of these invisible women, hidden away through controversy. Through Hansen\u2019s careful work, we see how the practice of polygamy affected every aspect of the LDS church\u2019s formation and is still a shadow hanging over the church, visible in it\u2019s approach to marriage, the role of women, and the temple ceremonies. Instead of the historical footnote polygamy is often treated as, Hansen shows how this practice, started in secret and a direct cause of Joseph Smith\u2019s death, responsible for driving the saints to Utah, and then outward again to Mexico and Canada, the root of power struggles both in the church and out, the cause of suspicion and eventually violence including the Mountain Meadows Massacre, was an instigator to most of the history of American West. For the first time, The Year of Polygamy shows how the west was settled not only to claim land and mineral rights, but in a very real way to control the bodies and sexuality of women in a way that reverberates today.

We're surrounded by the message that it's the tired life. The no-time-for-myself life. The hard life. We're supposed to get through it. Survive. Cling on by the last little thread. And at the same time, Carpe Diem - enjoy every moment because it's going to go by so fast. The typical mom culture sends us all kinds of mixed, typically negative messages. We shouldn't take care of ourselves; it's selfish. The more ragged you run yourself, the bigger your badge of honor. But also, ditch your mom bod and work out. Don't yell. Make more money. Show up. Be better, but not at the expense of time with your kids.I am putting a hard stop to all of this. While being a mom, running a business, and whatever else you might have going on is hard, it is a lot and there's lots of giving of yourself, the idea that motherhood means living a joyless, nonstop-hustle-with-zero-balance kind of life, where you give and give and give and never take, needs to stop.I'm on a mission to help you stop counting down the minutes 'til bedtime (at least most days). Stop the mom guilt and shame game. Stop cleaning up after your kids' childhood and start being present for it. I want to help you thrive in work, home, and life. I believe in John 10:10 that we are called to living an abundant life and I know moms are not excluded from that promise.

My name is Richard Ostler (twitter:  twitter.com/Papa_Ostler; FB: facebook.com/richard.ostler.5; IG: instagram.com/papa_ostler/) and am a native of Salt Lake City.  I am the author of \"Listen Learn and Love:  Embracing LGBTQ Latter-day Saints at Amazon (amazon.com/dp/1462135773) and Deseret Book (deseretbook.com/p/listen-learn-and-love-embracing-lgbtq-latter-day-saints)I am the author of two recent Ensign articles on \u2018How the Savior\u2019s Healing Power Applies to Repenting from Sexual Sin\u2019 (August 2020/YSA Digital Only) www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2020/08/young-adults/how-the-saviors-healing-power-applies-to-repenting-from-sexual-sinand \u20187 Tips for Overcoming Pornography Use\u2019 (October, page 72) www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2020/10/young-adults/7-tips-for-overcoming-pornography-useI have degrees from the University of Utah and Brigham Young University (business).  I married my best friend and eternal companion Sheila Juergens of Houston, Texas in 1990 and we are the parents of six children and several grandchildren and live near Cottonwood High School in Salt Lake City.   I believe in and am deeply committed to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and want it to work for a wider group.The name \u2018Papa Ostler\u2019 resulting from being introduced to Twitter by my High School age son Matt in 2010. I wanted the high school age youth to know I wasn\u2019t their age as I interacted with them \u2026 hence the name Papa Ostler.I served as a YSA Bishop in the West Valley City/Magna area of Salt Lake (released in 2016) and met some of the finest people I will ever know. In addition to meeting with wonderful active members of my Ward, I reached out and connected via social media (mostly via the private messaging features of FB and Twitter) with many of our inactive members and their non-member friends. Over time, many felt comfortable meeting with me and sharing their stories. Through hundreds of interviews and \u2018listening to understand\u2019, I was able to \u2018see\u2019 the church from the eyes of those on the outside.  Many feel the church is their \u2018spiritual home\u2019 but feel uncomfortable attending for a variety of reasons such as work-in-progress testimonies, concerns about church history, feeling unworthy because of past or current sin, don't fit the cultural mold, role of women, are LGBTQ and/or feel God's LGBTQ childen should be more welcomed in our congregations, etc.This podcast is designed to 'Have a Conversation' about some of the more complicated issues in our church to help all of us 'listen, learn and love' so we can minister in a more effective way to all of Heavenly Father\u2019s children.   Most podcasts will be from our LDS LGBTQ friends to give them voice so we can better understand their road, touch their cross, learn from them, and minister to them as directed by President M. Russell Ballard when he said \"We need to listen to and understand what our LGBT brothers and sisters are feeling and experiencing. Certainly, we must do better than we have done in the past so that all members feel they have a spiritual home where their brothers and sisters love them and where they have a place to worship and serve the Lord(Nov 2017 BYU Devotional).\"   Some podcasts will be from LGBTQ allies sharing their experiences and how to be helpful.  Other podcasts will be from guests talking about other complicated topics such as mental health, returning from a mission early, overcoming sin, and faith challenges.Are podcast are indexed by category at listenlearnandlove.org/podcastsThank you for joining us.

I\u2019ve written several Bible studies for Lifeway, including Finding God Faithful, All Things New, No Other Gods, Ruth, and a few others. I love to teach the Bible at my Cultivate Events across the country and also locally at my home church. I have a passion for missions, which is why I also work in the Amazon jungles of Brazil and the Eastern European country of Moldova with Justice & Mercy International. I wrote a book about my work in the Amazon called Wherever The River Runs. It\u2019s dear to my heart. I also love cooking, gardening, and having people to my house. It turns out, I pretty much wanted to write about that too, so a cookbook called A Place at the Table was born.

Is there someone in your life, past or present, who resembles my guest or the person to whom my guest is relating?Invite your mind to stillness, relax, pay attention moment by moment as you join us from wherever you are, as you relate what you hear to your own life, and experience the internal thrill of enlightenment\u2014not only as some exalted state of mind but as the elementary, doable, down-to-earth experience of understanding the cause of all suffering and how to end it. We exercise our bodies, but what about our minds? Think of this podcast as mental hygiene. I marvel at the courage, depth and humor that each guest brings to the table and invite you to get quiet, relax, move attention to your breath, open your heart and mind to inquiry. Now meet my next guest and let\u2019s do The Work.For more information, visit thework.com.", "link": "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/at-home-with-byron-katie/id1565280265"}, {"title": "ChannelB \u067e\u0627\u062f\u06a9\u0633\u062a \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u202a\u06cc\u202c", "producer": "Ali Bandari", "genre": "Society & Culture", "rating": 4.8, "num_ratings": 8300, "num_episodes": 83, "description": "\u062f\u0631 \u0647\u0631 \u0627\u067e\u06cc\u0632\u0648\u062f \u067e\u0627\u062f\u06a9\u0633\u062a \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc \u0686\u0646\u0644\u200c\u0628\u06cc \u06af\u0632\u0627\u0631\u0634 \u06cc\u06a9 \u0645\u0627\u062c\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639\u06cc \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u0646\u0642\u0644 \u0627\u0632 \u06cc\u06a9 \u0631\u0633\u0627\u0646\u0647\u200c\u06cc \u0645\u0639\u062a\u0628\u0631 \u0627\u0646\u06af\u0644\u06cc\u0633\u06cc\u200c\u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0634\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u0639\u0631\u06cc\u0641 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u0645.", "link": "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/channelb-%D9%BE%D8%A7%D8%AF%DA%A9%D8%B3%D8%AA-%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B3%DB%8C/id1070642732"}, {"title": "The Mysterious Mr. Epstein", "producer": "Wondery", "genre": "Society & Culture", "rating": 4.6, "num_ratings": 7400, "num_episodes": 11, "description": "We now know that Jeffrey Epstein was a sexual predator.

Kate covers a wide range of topics reflecting the current zeitgeist, i.e. celebrities, bloggers/influencers, social media, and tv/moves/music, but also focuses on the humor found in reexamining the 90s/00s zeitgeist as an adult, from AIM to Zenon. Whether musing about how so many 24-year-old bloggers have 5 kids and millions of dollars, poking holes in popular self-help gurus advice, deep diving about influencer/social media scandals, or explaining Taylor Swift's clue-dropping marketing strategy, Kate aims to dive into the topics everyone's talking about in chat rooms that don't get represented in newsrooms. (And by chat rooms, she realizes it's not 1999, but it sounded more quippy than online forums and Facebook groups). Beyond the more lighthearted topics, Kate is also a seasoned entrepreneur (of her namesake company Be There in Five) who is honest about her struggles in real-time and invites her listeners along as she, too, is trying to make it as a 30 something living in Chicago. Above all else, Kate started this podcast to champion lovers of pop culture by taking the guilt out of guilty pleasures. By speaking about the zeitgeist in an intelligent, unique, and humorous way, she hopes to assure listeners that these topics have value, contribute to society, and the only na\u00efve people are those who refuse to acknowledge their influence.", "link": "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/be-there-in-five/id1350320411"}, {"title": "I Weigh with Jameela Jamil", "producer": "Earwolf", "genre": "Society & Culture", "rating": 4.8, "num_ratings": 1700, "num_episodes": 68, "description": "What started as a social media post has become a mental health movement, and now a podcast.

Do you want to learn Bayesian inference, stay up to date or simply want to understand what Bayesian inference is?Then this podcast is for you! You'll hear from researchers and practitioners of all fields about how they use Bayesian statistics, and how in turn YOU can apply these methods in your modeling workflow.When I started learning Bayesian methods, I really wished there were a podcast out there that could introduce me to the methods, the projects and the people who make all that possible. So I created \"Learning Bayesian Statistics\", where you'll get to hear how Bayesian statistics are used to detect black matter in outer space, forecast elections or understand how diseases spread and can ultimately be stopped.But this show is not only about successes -- it's also about failures, because that's how we learn best. So you'll often hear the guests talking about what *didn't* work in their projects, why, and how they overcame these challenges. Because, in the end, we're all lifelong learners!My name is Alex Andorra by the way, and I live in Paris. By day, I'm a data scientist and modeler at the PyMC Labs consultancy. By night, I don't (yet) fight crime, but I'm an open-source enthusiast and core contributor to the python packages PyMC and ArviZ. I also love election forecasting and, most importantly, Nutella. But I don't like talking about it \u2013 I prefer eating it.So, whether you want to learn Bayesian statistics or hear about the latest libraries, books and applications, this podcast is for you -- just subscribe!

Betty and Dan Broderick had looked like the perfect couple, right up until they weren\u2019t. After four children and nearly 15 years of marriage, after the riches they both worked for were finally within reach, he walked out and began having an affair with his assistant.
