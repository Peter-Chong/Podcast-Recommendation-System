[{"title": "Curious City", "episodes": "The common stereotype for Midwesterners is that we\u2019re polite, friendly...and passive-aggressive. But is there any truth to that? Reporter Andrew Merriweather goes looking for the answer.Illinois passed a new law last month that sets a deadline for the state to replace all of its toxic lead service lines -- those pipes that deliver drinking water to our homes and park fountains. Curious City\u2019s Monica Eng fills us in on how long it's going to take to get rid of all the lead lines.Last year we met Elmhurst gardener Nicole Virgil, who was fighting for the right to put up a hoop house in her garden. A hoop house is an inexpensive way to help extend the growing season. It protects the crops from the wind and snow and can keep the soil from freezing.  Virgil took her fight all the way to the state legislature. Curious City\u2019s Monica Eng tells us what happened next.Little-known fact: in Chicago, you don\u2019t need to be an elected official to propose legislation to City Council. But does this process really work? Has anyone ever done it?  WBEZ city politics reporter Claudia Morell investigates. Along the way she speaks to a former governor and a cab driver who have tested it out for themselves.If you hear church bells ring in the Chicago-area, it\u2019s likely they\u2019re automated. Some bell systems are pneumatic or electronic. Others pipe digital hymns through amplifiers. But do real people ever ring real bells? That\u2019s the question we\u2019re exploring in this week\u2019s episode. And the answer is yes! We head to five different spots, each with its own sound, unique history and distinct community.In 1969, Chicago was home to one of history\u2019s most high-profile trials. Known as the Trial of the Chicago 8 \u2014 and sometimes the Trial of the Chicago 7 \u2014 the trial pitted anti-war protesters against the federal government. Eight men were accused of conspiring to incite a riot during protests that took place in Chicago during the Democratic National Convention of 1968. Outside the courtroom, protesters and onlookers gathered.  Some chanted to free the men.  Some came with signs and posters of protest and solidarity. In this episode, reporter Arionne Nettles explores the intersection of art and protest movements as she tries to track down the artist behind one of these posters."}, {"title": "Art History", "episodes": ""}, {"title": "The Cardone Zone", "episodes": ""}, {"title": "The \"What is Money?\" Show", "episodes": ""}, {"title": "FYI - For Your Innovation", "episodes": ""}, {"title": "Cum Town", "episodes": "okay pal sure, \"go\" pee pee then. right in my mouth why dont youthey a mak-uh us a gay, they make us looka like a gay man to raff at ushowdy bitchhey do u guys think stav would f**k cruellaand its like wa wa but for people with downs syndrome. how about that u f****n pieces of shitwhat am I like f****n 40 years old now f**k"}, {"title": "Armchair Expert Mondays with Dax Shepard", "episodes": ""}, {"title": "Rick & Bubba Show", "episodes": ""}, {"title": "Experts on Expert with Dax Shepard", "episodes": ""}, {"title": "Japanese podcast for beginners (Nihongo con Teppei\u202a)\u202c", "episodes": ""}, {"title": "The Clinical Problem Solvers", "episodes": "Rabih and Reza discuss\u00a0learning during the process of\u00a0clinical reasoning on VMR.\u00a0 Download CPSolvers App here Patreon website RLR website\u00a0\u00a0 VMR sign upSimone and Lindsey present a case to Dr. Kirsten Austad, followed by a discussion about women in leadership and \u201cthe double bind\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Kristen Austed\u00a0Kirsten Austad MD, MPH is an Assistant Professor of Family Medicine at Boston University School of Medicine and a hospitalist at Boston Medical Center.

Undergirded by racism, the Lost Cause apologia would stymie Reconstruction, justify decades of lynching and throughout the South, and prove as impossible to uproot as Kudzu.When it comes to art\u00a0identified\u00a0with the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, \u201cThe Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\u201d by The Band may be pop culture\u2019s most celebrated, and misunderstood, contribution. Despite its charged subject matter, the song is\u00a0rock-and-roll canon, listed as one of the best of all time by\u00a0Time Magazine\u00a0and\u00a0Rolling Stone.On paper, its lyrics read as if lifted from the Lost Cause playbook: a nostalgic retelling of the end of the Civil War history seen through the eyes of a downtrodden Southern farmer, laden with grief but not a trace of white supremacy. But the song is not what it seems, or what it seemed when it was first loosed upon the world. The Band\u2019s lead guitarist Robbie Robertson, a Canadian, hadn\u2019t logged much time\u00a0in the South\u00a0when he penned \u201cThe Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\u201d in 1969.\u00a0But in the ensuing decades, some have claimed it as a Neo-Confederate anthem. This uncomfortable fact\u00a0led Early James, a songwriter from Alabama, to alter the lyrics when he performed the song at an annual The Band tribute concert\u00a0last summer.\u00a0Inspired by last summer's racial reckoning, James sang about toppling Confederate monuments.\u00a0According to\u00a0Jack Hamilton, Slate pop critic and author of\u00a0Just Around Midnight: Rock and Roll and the Racial Imagination, the meaning behind the song is both more and less complex than many fans know.June 28th marks the anniversary of a mass shooting that took place inside a newsroom in Annapolis, Maryland, killing five journalists. On this week's On the Media, an intimate portrait of the staff of the Capital Gazette in the immediate aftermath of the death of their colleagues \u2014 and then over the next several years as they contend with a corporate takeover, buyouts, and the loss of their newsroom.

Joakim JohanssonWe Insist \u2014\u00a0Zo\u00eb KeatingIn the 1800s, New Bedford, Massachusetts was the world\u2019s \u201ccenter of whaling.\u201d More than half of the world\u2019s whaling ships in the 1840s came from New Bedford. The\u00a0small city was so emblematic of a New England whaling town that it served as the setting for Herman Melville\u2019s novel Moby Dick. According to the New York Times, it was then the richest city per capita on the continent.\u00a0 Now, more than a fifth of its approximately 95,000 citizens live in poverty.\u00a0But this exceptional historic town is representative of a phenomenon happening in small towns across the United States. It\u2019s local daily newspaper, The Standard-Times, has been bought by Gannett, a hedge fund-backed news conglomerate and stripped down to barebones.\u00a0It\u2019s become what\u2019s known as a \u201cghost newspaper,\" called such\u00a0for its trimmed down staff and scant original reporting. The mayor of New Bedford was quoted in the New York Times saying: \u201cIt used to be that I couldn\u2019t sneeze without having to explain myself. Now, I have to beg people to show up at my press conferences. Please, ask me questions!\u201d\u00a0A year and a half ago, a small group of concerned community members gathered to try to address this dearth of local journalism. The result? A new, non-profit news outlet called The New Bedford Light.\u00a0Brooke talks to Barbara Roessner, the founding editor of The New Bedford Light, about the\u00a0challenges facing the fledgling outlet\u00a0and the\u00a0benefits that local journalism brings to the civic\u00a0health of a community.New reports show that the Trump Department of Justice spied on reporters. But that\u2019s just a small part of a much longer story, going back decades. This week,\u00a0we examine when and why the government surveils journalists. And, following their first meeting this week, is there a headline beyond \u201cPutin and Biden talked to each other?\u201d Plus, on the 50th anniversary of the Pentagon Papers, how the story\u2019s biggest lessons were lost to time.\u00a01. Alexey Kovalev [@Alexey__Kovalev], investigative editor at Meduza, on what Russian and American media got right and wrong about Putin and Biden's first meeting. Listen.2.

The granddaddy of them all is\u00a0cancel culture. Michael Hobbes, co-host of the podcast You\u2019re Wrong About, told us that there isn\u2019t a situation that has been labeled a cancellation that couldn\u2019t benefit from a more accurate word to describe what had happened. So and so was fired...such and such was met with disagreement on twitter. Cancel need not apply.He also explained on his own podcast with Sarah Marshall that there were a few pivotal events along the way that led to the term cancel culture becoming the moral panic that it is today. One of them was the 2015 release of Jon Ronson\u2019s book \u201cSo You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed.\u201d A series of case studies of people who were canceled before we started using that word.Trump may be out of office, but the GOP's campaign to limit\u00a0voting rights, free speech, and reproductive rights is still in full-swing. On this week\u2019s On the Media, where do you\u00a0focus your attention when there are little fires everywhere? Plus, a look at a chilling new look\u00a0for America: the \"authoritarian mullet\" \u2014 culture war in the front, the destruction of democracy in the back. And, how critical race theory became a right-wing bogeyman.\u00a01. Jay Rosen [@jayrosen_nyu], professor of journalism at New York University and\u00a0media critic for PressThink, on why journalists should still be in \"emergency mode.\" Listen.2.

They talk about the history of these schools, which were a centerpiece of Canada\u2019s long-running effort to wipe out Indigenous culture and identity, and how the discovery of the children\u2019s bodies is forcing a political reckoning with this history among white Canadians. Then they compare how Canada is handling this issue to the way that other countries like the US, Germany, and Japan have dealt with their own histories of atrocity \u2014 and how that shapes both politics inside those countries and their relations with other states today.References:You can read the final report from Canada\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission here or on the Commission\u2019s website, where you can find additional information and resources on the commission and the residential school system, including more about the Missing Children Project.And here are the 94 \u201ccalls to action\u201d from the report, if you want to check those out in particular.\u00a0This is the op-ed by Jody Wilson-Raybould that Zack mentioned.This is the infamous 1892 \u201cKill the Indian...save the man\u201d speech by Richard Pratt, the US military officer who founded the Indian Industrial School at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, which became a model for similar forced-assimilation schools in the US and Canada.Here\u2019s more on the lawsuit seeking reparations for the cultural impact of the residential schools, which the Canadian government is currently fighting against.And here\u2019s more on the Pope\u2019s comments about the discovery at the Kamloops school, which notably do not include an apology for the Catholic church\u2019s role in running that and many of the other residential schools.Jenn mentioned the \u201cbirth alerts\u201d that were only ended in British Columbia in 2019.
