We see how hard it is.' Sometimes, it's not a political question or a political solution as far as who you vote for or what party you are in and then the conversation's over, because there's really hard, complicated discussions to be had beyond just your political party.\u201dSince the show started in 2015, the Kentucky-based Holland and Silvers sought to subvert the traditional left-right punditry of cable news to have what they describe as \u201cgrace-filled conversations\u201d which are more community-driven and derive from their own shared values and friendship. Both women grew up in Kentucky, studied law, and are raising families. It\u2019s in those shared experiences that they\u2019re able to stay truthful with each other, but also with their listeners\u2014many of whom appreciate their views regardless of the differences they might have. \u201cWe hear a lot of \u2018You're like our political therapists, you're our internet moms,\u2019\u201d Silvers says. \u201cThat feels right to me, because I think there are a lot of people who listen to our show who rarely agree with my political perspective, but they just like something about being able to sit and hear the news with us and know that we care about their feelings even if they are different than ours.

He relates that \"soon the requests began to grow to the point that we knew God was leading us into a wider ministry.\" As an extension of Dr. Rogers' pulpit ministry Love Worth Finding provided that role and continues today. Dr. Rogers stated, \"I believe God wants us to proclaim the message of salvation in the power of the Holy Spirit by every means possible. That\u2019s our commitment at Love Worth Finding.\" In response to many who are asking,has that purpose changed since the home-going of Dr. Rogers? No, God wants us to continue to proclaim the message of salvation. The messenger may be gone, but the message must continue. Millions still have not heard the precious name of Jesus or know His redeeming grace. So our race is not over. We must still rununtil Jesus comes. If you believe in what God has called LWF to do,we invite you to help us proclaim God's truth.
